#
# PURPOSE:
#     To have a command line flash card tool with minimal code, plain text input and output
#
# VISION:
#     The goal i have for this script is a basic level emulation of ANKI to where i have a way to
#     keep track of a score for each item in each selected deck so that it can pick from a selection
#     of the lowest scoring items and shuf them to the user for reenforcement of active recall.
