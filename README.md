# flash.sh

flashcards in your terminal!

This script is an expanded version of the one featured in [This Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lX8jqo70r1I)

My added components include testing for a `.flash/` directory in `$HOME` and inside that directory, that the `deck.csv` file exists.

if these items exist then the script will deliver you flash cards in your terminal.

the `deck.csv` file should have tab seperated values in 3 columns

| column 1 | column 2 | column3 |
| :-:      | :-:      | :-:     |
| category | question | answer  |

enjoy!
